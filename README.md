There are physical attributes like stomach or fullness, bladder or waste and energy or a general metric of wellbeing. There are also abstract attributes like positivity or mood and love or wellbeing. There are three threshold values for each attribute like stomach_down signifies a hungry state, stomach_nice signifies a good mean level of food and stomach_high which could indicate an over full level.
